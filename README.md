# image_processing_denoising

This is an attempt to learn how to process image data.
I'm using Colin Priest's tutorial on a kaggle dataset to denoise images.

1. The image_proc_denoise_linear file uses a linear regression model to clean the image.
As you can see, it gets pretty good results. However, better results are possible.
